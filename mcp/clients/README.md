# MCP Clients

## Purpose
Build MCP clients inside AI hosts, IDEs, agent runtimes, desktop apps, and service backends that need controlled access to external context and actions.

- ARCHITECTURE.md
- WORKFLOW.md
- CHECKLIST.md
- PROMPTS.md
- EXAMPLES.md

## When to use
Use this module when an application must discover MCP server capabilities, route model requests to tools or resources, manage user consent, or mediate sampling calls.

## When not to use
Do not start here when you are only designing one server-side integration; use the server, tool, resource, or transport modules first.

## MCP topics covered
- host policy
- capability discovery
- consent UX
- sampling mediation
- result provenance
- JSON-RPC request and response flow
- Debugging, testing, deployment, and performance review
- OpenAI integration and Claude integration

## Practical workflow
1. Define the user workflow, host boundary, and success criteria.
2. Identify the MCP responsibilities: host policy, capability discovery, consent UX, sampling mediation, result provenance.
3. Separate resources for context from tools for actions and prompts for reusable workflows.
4. Choose stdio for local trusted integrations or Streamable HTTP for remote shared services.
5. Specify authentication, authorization, consent, logging, and error behavior before implementation.
6. Build contract tests for initialization, discovery, JSON-RPC calls, errors, cancellation, and timeout paths.
7. Document OpenAI, Claude, debugging, deployment, and operational assumptions before release.

## OpenAI integration
In OpenAI agent or tool workflows, expose only the capabilities required for the task, validate server identity, review tool and resource descriptions, require approval for side effects, and preserve provenance for every MCP result used in a final answer.

## Claude integration
In Claude and Claude Code workflows, keep server configuration explicit, apply least privilege to local and remote servers, document reachable workspace or account data, and require confirmation before writes, deployments, or external notifications.
